# frontend_personal_blog

## What is the repository for?

Currently I am taking a Udacity Nanodegree Course in Frontend Web Development. As a part of the program one project is to develop an own personal Blog Site. 

The project is to showcase the learned HTML and CSS skills. The website has a responsive design and incorporates CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.
