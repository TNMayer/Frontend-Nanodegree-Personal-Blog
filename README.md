## Project 1: Personal Blog

### What is the repository for?

Currently I am taking a Udacity Nanodegree Course in Frontend Web Development. As a part of the program one project is to develop an own Web Blog Layout. 

The project is to showcase the learned HTML and CSS skills. The website has a responsive design and incorporates CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.
